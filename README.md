# Real-Time Baggage Screening System Using YOLO and OpenCV

This project is a real-time object detection system designed to assist in baggage screening by identifying prohibited items such as knives, weapons, and batteries. Built using (YOLO) and (OpenCV), the system serves as a pre-scanning phase to support security personnel by automatically flagging unauthorized objects. This reduces manual workload and improves overall security efficiency.

## üß† Project Background

This system was developed as part of the (Image Processing and Computer Vision) program by (Tuwaiq Academy). It demonstrates the practical application of machine learning and computer vision techniques in real-world scenarios such as airport security screening.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time object detection using (YOLOv8)
- Identification of prohibited items (Knives, Weapons, Batteries)
- Live camera or video feed processing via (OpenCV)
- Visual alerts on detection
- Easy-to-use and extendable codebase

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Google Colab (for development and testing)
- Deep learning models pre-trained on COCO and custom datasets


üìπ How It Works
	1.	Load the YOLOv8 model.
	2.	Capture real-time video using OpenCV.
	3.	Process each frame to detect prohibited objects.
	4.	Display bounding boxes and alert labels on detected items.

‚úÖ Results

The system successfully identifies target items in various baggage images and video feeds, offering high-speed detection suitable for real-time applications.

üß™ Future Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Train with a larger, custom dataset of X-ray baggage images
	‚Ä¢	Improve detection accuracy through fine-tuning
	‚Ä¢	Deploy on edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano)
	‚Ä¢	Integrate with airport or checkpoint management systems
